# Features of this project
1. Multiple User profiles, authentication, and authorization via Backend.
3. Each User can create events that can be seen by the creator/owner User only.
4. The password of each user is stored in hashed form in the database.
5. Using a logger `morgan`, to display logs on each API request on the console and a particular log file.
6. Right now, `CORs` are set to allow everyone to access the server.
7. The APIs in this project have proper validation for inputs using `express-validator` and proper error messages respectively.
8. We are using `JWT tokens` for authentication and authorization.
9. Separate routes to create new **Events** and get all **Events**.
10. Separate route for signup and login operations for **Users**.
11. Simple UI with a login page, list all events page and create a new event modal with button.
12. Created multiple robust-flexible Custom Hooks and Component UI components to support multiple use cases.
13. File upload input in the Create New Event screen (As of now we are not saving that file anywhere).
14. Fully responsive with mobile (max 640), medium and large viewports/screens ( kind of created our own component library for reusing the same components at multiple places and to support multiple use cases ).
15. Interactive Form if possible should try to play with the form ( Not the best but it's ok ).

# Things that can be improved in this project
1. A message Modal to display error and successful messages in Frontend for better UX.
2. More flexibility and customization with events can be done like an event management system.
3. Each user can have its own proper dashboard, which will return its relevant events, details, and stats.
4. More detailed error messages.
5. Test cases can be added.

I hope you like this project. In case of any queries, Please feel free to contact me via `deepanshujain088@gmail.com`
